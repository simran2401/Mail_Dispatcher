Email communication has become an integral part of our daily lives, and sending 
bulk emails to multiple recipients is a common practice for businesses and individuals 
alike. However, manually entering email addresses or copying and pasting them one by 
one is a time-consuming task.


To address this challenge, we have developed a Mass Mail Dispatcher using HTML, 
CSS, JS, and EmailJS API. This web-based application simplifies the process of sending 
bulk emails to a large group of recipients with a single click. Additionally, our system has 
the added feature of allowing users to upload a CSV file containing multiple email 
addresses.


The Mass Mail Dispatcher has been designed with a user-friendly interface that makes it 
easy for individuals and businesses to send multiple emails quickly and efficiently. The 
system can sort the valid and invalid email addresses from the CSV file and display the 
results to the user. This feature ensures that the user can quickly identify and remove any 
incorrect email addresses from their mailing list.
